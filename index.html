        <p><img src="./Document_files/Cars-1.jpg" alt="Cars">Understanding the various car body styles can help you choose a vehicle that best fits your needs and preferences. Here's an overview of some common car types:

            1. Sedan
            
            A sedan is a passenger car with a three-box configuration, typically featuring four doors and a separate trunk. It's designed to comfortably seat four or more passengers.
            
            2. Hatchback
            
            Hatchbacks are characterized by a rear door that swings upward, providing access to the cargo area. They often have a two-box design and can come with either two or four doors.
            
            3. Coupe
            
            Traditionally, a coupe is a two-door car with a fixed roof and a sporty appearance. However, modern interpretations may include four-door vehicles with a sloping roofline.

            4. Convertible
            
            Convertibles, also known as cabriolets, have a retractable roof, allowing drivers to enjoy open-air driving. They can be either soft-top or hard-top.
            
            5. SUV (Sport Utility Vehicle)
            
            SUVs are larger vehicles designed for both on-road and off-road use. They typically offer higher ground clearance and can accommodate more passengers and cargo.
            
            6. Crossover
            
            Crossovers combine features of SUVs and passenger cars, offering a car-like ride with the utility of an SUV. They are usually built on a unibody frame.
            
            7. Pickup Truck
            
            Pickup trucks have an enclosed cabin and an open cargo area with low sides and a tailgate. They are popular for their utility and towing capabilities.
            
            8. Minivan
            
            Designed primarily for passenger comfort, minivans offer spacious interiors with three rows of seating, making them ideal for larger families.</p>
